<p>Except to work better with your dining room your countertops should be cream not white. I would still install a white kitchen in a white house thats for sure. The white or cream you choose will depend entirely upon the countertop. Source I saw this image today in my travels and thought it was fabulous.

<p>The following is not my favorite kitchen ever but it looks like rustic cherry floors and cabinets the pantry door looks like a fir and all the rest of the trim iswhite.

This can either be achieved through using complimentary or contrasting colors depending on the look that is desired. Again this combination of multiple colors will work best in a kitchen where there is enough access to natural light for it to have a cozy and casual look.
