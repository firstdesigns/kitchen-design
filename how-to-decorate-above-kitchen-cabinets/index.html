<p>If you prefer a clean look but dont want to see that awkward space above the kitchen cabinets fill it in. Install crown molding in your own home If your cabinets are squared off and plain at the top adding molding is an inexpensive way to dress them up and make them look more substantial. Bring in accents such as woven baskets reclaimed wood decor greenery or colorful pottery to round out your space. You could use vintage art or black and white portraits. Cleverly use the area above your cabinets to hold baskets making for additional storage space in your kitchen.
