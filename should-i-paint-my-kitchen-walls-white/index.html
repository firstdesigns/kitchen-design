Like any trend though gray may have finally played out. My daughter in law upon buying a house with great white rooms in the front said that Yes they looked nice but she couldnt bear to leave them such a Non-Color when there were so many GREAT COLORS in the world. What Colour Should I Paint My Kitchen With White Cabinets My Decorative Traditional Kitchen Renovation Kitchen Design Antique White Kitchen.</p>

<p>Photo via Kitchens of Diablo. Try to avoid ultra-pure shades of white as they tend to lend a chilly feel to many kitchens. The walls and floor if you have tiles if they are smooth. Darker shades help shrink the appearance of the room. Im in the process of painting my formerly green and white striped kitchen a pale cream on the walls with white trim and white cabinets.
