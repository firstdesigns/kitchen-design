<p>For those who dont like uber white cabinets light coloured cabinets are a great choice as they are fresh and bright without being too white. I do like the touches of black accent though. The oak grain is still visible but completely filled in leaving a really beautiful finish. The white high gloss finish is continued on the flushed cabinets on the kitchens back wall complemented by stainless steel appliances and white backsplash. Since we have almost brand new white kitchen appliances the previous homeowners purchased we wont be upgrading to stainless anytime in the near future so we figured we would help the white appliances blend in as opposed to stand out.
