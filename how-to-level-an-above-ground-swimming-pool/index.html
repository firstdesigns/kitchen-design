<p>Do a visual inspection to check for any. That way it is level with the rest of your pool. Level an Above-Ground Pool Step 1. Acquire a 1-inch by 6-inch plank of wood 6-inches longer than the radius of the pool. Unless the pool is fixed entirely then your work is far from over.

<p>Once you have the pool level and are ready to refill it I like to use a shopvac on 2 sides of the pool and drop the hose behind the liner. Its works really well and surprisingly easy. If the pool is full with water drain it. Duct tape a 4. You can secure the level onto the two-by-four with cable ties which can be reusable.
